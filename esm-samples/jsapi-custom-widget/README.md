# Building custom UI

At 4.27 this custom widget sample was replaced by the [jsapi-custom-ui](../jsapi-custom-ui/) sample.

The pattern of subclassing or extending `/esri/widgets/Widget` is no longer recommended for creating custom UI elements. That pattern creates dependencies on SDK internals and can result in frequent and undocumented breaking changes.
